{"name":"ShapecatcherKit","body":"**ShapecatcherKit** is an Objective-C framework for [shapecatcher.com](http://shapecatcher.com) that provides full support for the API to recognize unicode shapes from drawings and rate the results.\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/kgn/ShapecatcherKit/raw/master/Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n*Please note the sample app does not include drawing code, it's purpose is only to demonstrate how to use the api.*\r\n\r\n*Also `ShapecatcherKitTestApiKey.h` is referenced from the sample app but missing from the project because it \r\ncontains my private api key, you will need to request your own :)*\r\n\r\n# How toâ€¦\r\n\r\nThe sample application included with this project demonstrates how to fully use the API but here are some code snippets.\r\n\r\nFirst set your api key on the `sharedKit`:\r\n\r\n``` obj-c\r\n[[ShapecatcherKit sharedKit] setApiKey:@\"<your private api key>\"];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can recognize `NSImage`s asynchronously:\r\n\r\n``` obj-c\r\n[[ShapecatcherKit sharedKit] recognizeFromImage:image withSuccess:^(NSArray *shapes){\r\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", shapes);\r\n} andFailure:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `shapes` array contains `SKShape` objects with all the data from the api. This object also allows you to asynchronously request an image of the shape and rate how well the shape matches the drawing:\r\n\r\n``` obj-c\r\n[shape requestCharacterImageWithSuccess:^(NSImage *image){\r\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", image);\r\n} andFailure:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` obj-c\r\n[shape setRating:SKShapeGoodRating withSuccess:^(){\r\n    NSLog(@\"%@\", image);\r\n} andFailure:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\nShapes can be rated *good*(`SKShapeGoodRating`) *bad*(`SKShapeBadRating`) or the previous rating can be undone with *undo*(`SKShapeUndoRating`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**ShapecatcherKit** is available under the MIT license.
